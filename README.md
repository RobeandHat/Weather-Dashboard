# Weather-Dashboard

## What is this code?

This is code for a weather dashboard that allows the user to pull weather data on the city they enter. The dashboard pulls temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and the date. The dashboard also generates a 5 day forecast for the city and saves previous city searches. These saved searches can be clicked to pull up the same data as the original search.
